# snakeJS

A simple Snake game implemented in JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game using JavaScript. The game includes a snake that moves around the grid, attempting to eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with its own body.

## Features

- Snake movement in four directions: up, down, left, right.
- Food generation at random locations.
- Collision detection to handle snake interactions with its own body.
- Simple scoring mechanism.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.
3. The snake will grow longer each time it eats the food.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the game board boundaries or its own body.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for rendering the game.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for styling the game components.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
